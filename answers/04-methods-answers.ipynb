    "- data, of various types\n",
    "- the operations and functions we perform on the data\n",
    "\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "- `x + y` applies the `+` operator to two data operands, to add them\n",
    "- `len('Hello world')` applies the `len()` function to data of type `str` to find its length\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of simple bits of Python like this, but in reality, data and functionality are bundled together, defined in programming objects called *classes*. We will look at this in the lectures, but in summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A class defines both the type of data and the functionality that can be carried out on it\n",
    "- When we create literals and variables, we are creating individual examples, or *instances* of a class. For example:\n",
    "  - `Hello world` is an *instance* of the `str` class\n",
    "  - `2.3` is an *instance* of the `float` class\n",
    "  - `values = [1, 2, 3]` defines a variable called `values` which refers to an *instance* of the `list` class\n",
    "- The functionality that a class defines is used to manipulate its data\n",
    "- A piece of functionality is defined as a *method* of the class.\n",
    "- We will look at examples using strings, but the idea applies to any data type.\n",
